Subject: [PATCH 400/858] [kdump] add CONFIG_KEXEC_AUTO_RESERVE and document
 crashkernel=auto

Bugzilla: 820427

This is a backport from the following RHEL6 commit:

  b1c7a27 [kdump] revert commit 8f4ec27fc to keep crashkernel=auto

Along with reverting the removal of automatic reserve of memory for kexec
kernel (crashkernel=auto) support that commit also added a configuration
switch, CONFIG_KEXEC_AUTO_RESERVE, to enable and disable ththis feature.
Documentation was also addded.
