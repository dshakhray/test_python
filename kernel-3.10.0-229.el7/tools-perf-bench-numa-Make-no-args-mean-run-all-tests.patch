description
===========
If we call just:

  perf bench numa mem

it will present the same output as:

  perf bench numa mem -h

i.e. ask for instructions about what to run.

While that is kinda ok, using 'run all tests' as the default, i.e.
making 'no parms' be equivalent to:

  perf bench numa mem -a

Will allow:

  perf bench numa all

to actually do what is asked: i.e. run all the 'bench' tests, instead of
responding to that by asking what to do.

That, in turn, allows:

  perf bench all

to actually complete, for the same reasons.

And after that, the tests that come after that, and that at some point
hit a NULL deref, will run, allowing me to reproduce a recently reported
problem.

That when you have the needed numa libraries, which wasn't the case for
the reporter, making me a bit confused after trying to reproduce his
report.

So make no parms mean -a.
