cdfdbdc5dcce48bf2b2c13353a8abb5afb432eea
CIFS: Cleanup cifs open codepath
introduced in bz 1082049.
The regression was introduced upstream which was subsequently backported
to RHEL 7. The fix for the regression was also posted upstream.

This leaves the user unable to create a MFSymlink. The bug was detected by QE
when testing cifs updates for RHEL 7.1.
