    blk-mq: request deadline must be visible before marking rq as started

    When we start the request, we set the deadline and flip the bits
    marking the request as started and non-complete. However, it's
    important that the deadline store is ordered before flipping the
    bits, otherwise we could have a small window where the request is
    marked started but with an invalid deadline. This can confuse the
    timeout handling.
