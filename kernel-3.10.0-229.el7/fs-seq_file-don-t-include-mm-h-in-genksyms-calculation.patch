Bugzilla bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183280
Upstream commit: N/A

Changes to resolve memory allocation failure due to fragmentation for
bug 1095623 added an include of mm.h in fs/seq_file.c. This caused
the checksum for several seq_* functions to change as some referenced
structures where no longer opaque to genksyms.

As a result this introduced unnecessary incompatibility for customer
external modules that used these symbols even though the seq_*
function signatures and there semantics had not changed.

Resolve this by excluding mm.h from the genksyms calculation.
