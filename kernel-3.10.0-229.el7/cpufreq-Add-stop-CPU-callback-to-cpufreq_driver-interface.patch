    cpufreq: Add stop CPU callback to cpufreq_driver interface

    This callback allows the driver to do clean up before the CPU is
    completely down and its state cannot be modified.  This is used
    by the intel_pstate driver to reduce the requested P state prior to
    the core going away.  This is required because the requested P state
    of the offline core is used to select the package P state. This
    effectively sets the floor package P state to the requested P state on
    the offline core.
