    xfs: unmount does not wait for shutdown during unmount

    And interesting situation can occur if a log IO error occurs during
    the unmount of a filesystem. The cases reported have the same
    signature - the update of the superblock counters fails due to a log
    write IO error:

    XFS (dm-16): xfs_do_force_shutdown(0x2) called from line 1170 of file fs/xfs/xfs_log.c.  Return address = 0xffffffffa08a44a1
    XFS (dm-16): Log I/O Error Detected.  Shutting down filesystem
    XFS (dm-16): Unable to update superblock counters. Freespace may not be correct on next mount.
    XFS (dm-16): xfs_log_force: error 5 returned.
    XFS (ÃÂ¿-ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿): Please umount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)

    It can be seen that the last line of output contains a corrupt
    device name - this is because the log and xfs_mount structures have
    already been freed by the time this message is printed. A kernel
    oops closely follows.

    The issue is that the shutdown is occurring in a separate IO
    completion thread to the unmount. Once the shutdown processing has
    started and all the iclogs are marked with XLOG_STATE_IOERROR, the
    log shutdown code wakes anyone waiting on a log force so they can
    process the shutdown error. This wakes up the unmount code that
    is doing a synchronous transaction to update the superblock
    counters.

    The unmount path now sees all the iclogs are marked with
    XLOG_STATE_IOERROR and so never waits on them again, knowing that if
    it does, there will not be a wakeup trigger for it and we will hang
    the unmount if we do. Hence the unmount runs through all the
    remaining code and frees all the filesystem structures while the
    xlog_iodone() is still processing the shutdown. When the log
    shutdown processing completes, xfs_do_force_shutdown() emits the
    "Please umount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)" message,
    and xlog_iodone() then aborts all the objects attached to the iclog.
    An iclog that has already been freed....

    The real issue here is that there is no serialisation point between
    the log IO and the unmount. We have serialisations points for log
    writes, log forces, reservations, etc, but we don't actually have
    any code that wakes for log IO to fully complete. We do that for all
    other types of object, so why not iclogbufs?

    Well, it turns out that we can easily do this. We've got xfs_buf
    handles, and that's what everyone else uses for IO serialisation.
    i.e. bp->b_sema. So, lets hold iclogbufs locked over IO, and only
    release the lock in xlog_iodone() when we are finished with the
    buffer. That way before we tear down the iclog, we can lock and
    unlock the buffer to ensure IO completion has finished completely
    before we tear it down.
