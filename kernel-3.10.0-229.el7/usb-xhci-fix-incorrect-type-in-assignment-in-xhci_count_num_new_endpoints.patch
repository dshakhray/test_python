    xhci: fix incorrect type in assignment in xhci_count_num_new_endpoints()

    The fields 'add_flags' and 'drop_flags' in struct xhci_input_control_ctx
    have type __le32 and need to be converted to CPU byteorder before being
    used to derive the number of added endpoints.
    This bug was found using sparse.

    This patch is not suitable for stable, since the bug would only be
    triggered on big endian systems, and the code only runs for Intel xHCI
    host controllers, which are always integrated into little endian
    systems.
